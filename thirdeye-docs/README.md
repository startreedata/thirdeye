# ThirdEye Documentation

This directory contains the documentation for ThirdEye. It is available online at https://thirdeye.readthedocs.io. 

### Build

ThirdEye documentation is built using [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/). It gets built along with the install phase.
```bash
mvn install -pl 'thirdeye-docs' -am
```

**NOTE. This section below requires update and is a WIP**


If you have python/pip, you can install the dependencies using the command below.
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
``` 

Build docs using
```
make html
```
The rendered html can be found at `_build/html/index.html`

### Updating docs
1. Edit or add files as needed.
2. Build using `make livedocs`.
3. Open `_build/html/index.html` in your favorite browser. The page should auto-update with your changes.
4. Ensure the contents and links work correctly
5. Submit a PR!


> NOTE: You may see some differences locally as the version of `sphinx-build` on your local host might not be the same as the one used in [readthedocs.io](https://readthedocs.io) for building the pinot website docs.
