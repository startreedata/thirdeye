/**
 * An entity represents a node in the knowledge graph traversed to identify potential root causes.
 * The URN represents a unique identifier (with a hierarchical namespace) and the score identifies
 * the relative importance to other entities given a specific context.
 * In the user-specified search context, the score represents the subjective importance of the
 * entity as determined by the user. In the execution context and the pipeline results the score
 * represents the relative importance of entities associated with the search context as determined
 * by individual pipelines and the aggregator.
 *
 * <br/><b>NOTE:</b> a subclass of {@code Entity} may be returned by pipelines in order to pass
 * along transient meta-data for individual entities.
 *
 * <br/><b>NOTE:</b> due to the potentially vast number of nodes in the knowledge graph there is no
 * centralized repository of valid URNs.
